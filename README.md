# OpticalCharacterRecognition
A classic problem in computer vision recognizing written text through pictures. 

This problem was tackled in two parts:

## 1. [EMNIST Classification](https://github.com/hxt1965/OpticalCharacterRecognition/blob/master/emnist_classification%20.ipynb) 
The [EMNIST dataset](https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset) was fed into a Sequential Neural Network consisting of 10 layers, namely, 
 - Conv2D
 - MaxPooling2D
 - Dropout
 - Dense 
The model achieved an accuracy of 85.86%

## 2. Line Segmentation
