# OpticalCharacterRecognition
A classic problem in computer vision recognizing
written text through pictures. This project seeks
to address this, and recognizes latin characters
via a neural network. It does not exclusively rec-
ognize the text of a handwritten character from
a single image of that character. Instead, the
project identies all characters in an image of
multiple characters. Simply put, this project is
an OCR model for the English language.
